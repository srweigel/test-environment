# 2840 Mounting and Trimming Training Guide
Revision 1 - 10/8/2024

## Purpose:
The purpose of this document is to provide a standardized process for print mounting, trimming, and operation of the associated equipment.  This document also includes information about print preparation and inspection.

## Scope of Work:
This process should be utilized for mounting and trimming photo and fine art prints.

## Required Tools and Materials:
- Cut-resistant Gloves
- Utility Blade
- Cutting Mat (for canvas)
- Tablet and Scanner
- Mounting Substrate
- Shop Rags
- Goo Gone/Goof Off
- Craft Knife
- Burnishing Tool
- Ball Point Pen Cap
- DRS Roller and DRS Pad

# Procedure
1.	Confirm the roller height and tension are set to the appropriate level.  Tension should be set with the bottom of the indicator at “1”.  To set the height, raise the roller with the blue height adjustment handles so there is a visible gap between them, then lower the top roller until the two rollers are touching.  The white lines on either blue handle should match.
2.	Engage the foot pedal to advance the roller so all dust transfers from the bottom to the top roller.  Then peel the adhesive liner from a rejected substrate and run it through the roller, sticky side up, to clean it.  If additional debris becomes attached to the roller, this cleaning should be repeated as necessary.
3.  Prepare the mounting station by using a DRS roller to remove any dust or debris from the tabletop.  This preparation should be performed after every 2 to 3 batches or as needed.
4.  Stage the next batch of orders at the prep cart near the mounting station. Each batch should contain 10 orders.
5.	Beginning with the first order in the batch, inspect all prints for defects or handling damage.  If there are no printing defects in the first order, proceed to step 6.  If any defects are found, continue to mount all viable pieces in the order, label and set them on the reprint cart, and request all necessary reprints together before moving on to the next order.
