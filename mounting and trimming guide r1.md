# 2840 Mounting and Trimming Training Guide
- Revision 1
- Last updated: 10/8/2024
- 2840 Finishing

## Purpose:
The purpose of this document is to provide a standardized process for print mounting, trimming, and operation of the associated equipment.  This document also includes information about print preparation and inspection.

## Scope of Work:
This process should be utilized for mounting and trimming photo and fine art prints.

## Limitations:
This process should not be utilized for mounting and trimming canvas prints.  For any prints larger than 30x40, mounting and trimming should be done with the support of another member of the production staff.

## Required Tools and Materials:
- Mounting Substrate
- DRS Roller and DRS Pad
- Goo Gone/Goof Off
- Shop Rags
- Cut-resistant Gloves
- Utility Blade
- Burnishing Tool
- Ball Point Pen Cap
- Tablet and Scanner

# Procedure
#### 1.	Confirm the roller height and tension are set to the appropriate level.  Tension should be set with the bottom of the indicator at “1”.  To set the height, raise the roller with the blue height adjustment handles so there is a visible gap between them, then lower the top roller until the two rollers are touching.  The white lines on either blue handle should match.

#### 2.	Engage the foot pedal to advance the roller so all dust transfers from the bottom to the top roller.  Then peel the adhesive liner from a rejected substrate and run it through the roller, sticky side up, to clean it.  If additional debris becomes attached to the roller, this cleaning should be repeated as necessary.

#### 4.  Prepare the mounting station by using a DRS roller to remove any dust or debris from the tabletop.  This preparation should be performed after every 2 to 3 batches or as needed.

#### 5.  Stage the next batch of orders at the prep cart near the mounting station. Each batch should contain 10 orders.

#### 6.	Beginning with the first order in the batch, inspect all prints for defects or handling damage.  If there are no printing defects in the first order, proceed to step 6.  If any defects are found, continue to mount all viable pieces in the order, label and set them on the reprint cart, and request all necessary reprints together before moving on to the next order.

#### 7.	Review the order form to confirm what types and sizes of mounting substrates are required for the order and gather the appropriate components at the mounting station.

#### 8.	Dry-fit the print by placing it on top of its corresponding substrate to confirm the substrate is sized correctly.  If any pieces of substrate are sized incorrectly, pull new ones or bring them to the Finishing lead to have new ones ordered.  If there are no issues, proceed to the next step.

#### 9.	Prepare the substrate by rolling the entire surface of the adhesive liner with a DRS roller to remove all dust or debris.

#### 10.	Peel half of the adhesive liner back and check for bumps or dents in the substrate.

11.	Repair any minor bumps by pressing them flat with a burnishing tool.  If there are irreparable bumps, reapply the adhesive liner and set the rejected substrate aside to be used for future roller cleanings.  If no bumps are present, proceed to step 11.
12.	Reapply the adhesive liner and peel away the other half to inspect the remaining section of the substrate.  Repair any minor bumps with a burnishing tool.
13.	Reapply the adhesive liner so the entire substrate is covered.
14.	Roll the substrate with a DRS roller once more to remove any dust or debris.
15.	Check for visible backwriting by holding each print up to the light.  If backwriting is visible from the front, remove it from the print using Goo Gone or Goof Off and a paper towel or shop rag.  If no backwriting is visible, proceed to the next step.
16.	Roll the entire back surface of the print with a DRS roller to remove all dust and debris.  When rolling prints always place them onto their accompanying pads, bags, or envelopes.  No prints should be placed face-down onto another part of the workstation.
17.	Peel back 2 to 3 inches of the adhesive liner along the long side of the substrate and crease it firmly so it does not reattach itself to the adhesive.
18.	Carefully line up the print on top of the mounting substrate.  The print should be mounted centered on the substrate, with an equal amount of overhang on all sides.
19.	Attach the print to the mounting substrate by applying gentle pressure.
20.	Begin to remove the adhesive liner from the mounting substrate so the print has room to adhere to the rest of the substrate.
21.	Load the partially mounted print into a clean and appropriately sized mounting roller, leading with the mounted edge face up.
22.	Use the foot pedal to activate the mounting roller and slowly remove the rest of the adhesive liner as the board and print are pulled through.
23.	Catch the mounted print as it exits the roller and inspect the quality of the mount.  Repair any defects as applicable using a burnishing tool or a pen cap.
24.	Once all 10 orders in the batch are mounted, shift the order to the trimming area.  Stack prints face-to-face and back-to-back to prevent scratches.
25.	Put a cut-resistant glove on the hand used to hold the substrate.
26.	Install a new blade in the utility knife.  Fresh blades will produce cleaner cuts and should be changed frequently.  Used blades should be discarded into a yellow blade disposal container.
27.	Lift the mounted print off the table, with the print facing away, and grip it firmly with a cut-resistant glove.
28.	Hold the knife firmly and with a straight wrist as shown.
29.	Hold the print edge to be cut at a 45-degree angle and pull the blade along the edge of the substrate to create a flush cut.  While cutting, the wrist should remain locked in a straight position, and all pulling should be done from the elbow and shoulder.  Trim all 4 edges in this fashion.
30.	For larger prints, place the edge of the print on the table with the edge being trimmed facing up and the print facing away.  Make a straight cut along the edge of the print flush against the mounting substrate.  Trim all 4 edges in this fashion.
31.	Inspect the print and substrate once more for any defects.  Inspect the edges for crooked or rough cuts.
32.	Initial the order form next to all prints that have been mounted.
33.	Move the order to the appropriate bucket or cart for sorting into the next department.
